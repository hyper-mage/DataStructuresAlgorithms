Should be able to load the .cpp file into any standard compiler, or ran in any ide (Visual Studio doesn't output anything for me though).
I used CLion to write the code, therefore it should compile if the configurations are set.

***Easiest method***
	1. copy the .cpp text using a text editor (atom, sublime, notepad, etc)
	2. goto https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler
	3. paste over the code
	4. hit Run (in green at the top)
	5. the output terminal should appear at the bottom

	120 >>> values for nodes of tree (first input will be root of tree)
	146 >>> pick leaf nodes to delete (use the identifyLeaf function to specify what leaves)
	154 >>> pick subtree nodes to delete (Just pick a value that is not the root or leaves)
