The purpose of this assingment is to run Dijkstra's Algorithm on a graph. I have chosen to go with an adjacency matrix representation.
    // 1. make a graph. you can use any representation. The graph must have at least 10 nodes and 15 edges. undirected graph.
    // 2. run Dijkstra's algorithm.
    //  submit screen shot and the code.
// I tried to use the priority queue from c++ stl, but did not understand it enough
// Below is a version from geeksforgeeks, may resubmit if I can get the priority queue one to work

Should be able to load the .cpp file into any standard compiler, or ran in any ide (Visual Studio doesn't output anything for me though).
I used CLion to write the code, therefore it should compile if the configurations are set.

***Easiest method***
	1. copy the .cpp text using a text editor (atom, sublime, notepad, etc)
	2. goto https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler
	3. paste over the code
	4. hit Run (in green at the top)
	5. the output terminal should appear at the bottom

	82 >>> A big ugly adjacency matrix is there for inputting values. It's not very clean, i'm sorry.
