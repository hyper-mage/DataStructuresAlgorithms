The purpose of this assignment is to create a data structure (Singly Linked List) to traverse and sort. 
The sorting portion focuses on rearranging the pointers of each node rather than replacing its data.
    // 1. Traverse list
    // 2. Selection sort the list, changing node links but not node data
    // 3. Traverse again
    // 4. Profit

Should be able to load the .cpp file into any standard compiler, or ran in any ide (Visual Studio doesn't output anything for me though).
I used CLion to write the code, therefore it should compile if the configurations are set.

***Easiest method***
	1. copy the .cpp text using a text editor (atom, sublime, notepad, etc)
	2. goto https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler
	3. paste over the code
	4. hit Run (in green at the top)
	5. the output terminal should appear at the bottom
